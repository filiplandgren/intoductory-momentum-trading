A first example of a momentum-based trading strategy:

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing a basic momentum trading strategy. The strategy is designed to exploit short-term price trends in financial markets.

Momentum trading is a popular strategy in finance where investors buy and hold assets that have shown an upward price trend and sell assets that have shown a downward price trend. This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the implementation of a simple momentum trading strategy using historical stock price data.

To run the Jupyter Notebook and experiment with the momentum trading strategy, you need the following dependencies:
Python (3.6 or higher)
Jupyter Notebook
pandas
numpy
matplotlib


The notebook demonstrates the basic steps of a momentum trading strategy:

Data Loading: Loading historical stock price data.
Signal Generation: Generating buy/sell signals based on a simple momentum indicator.
Backtesting: Simulating trades and calculating returns based on the generated signals.
By following the notebook, you can gain insights into how momentum strategies work and their potential pros and cons.

For more details please visit Free Code Camp. This was part of a basic course on algorithmic trading.  The purpose of this project was for me to code a very basic yet explicit first example of a momentum-based investment strategy.
